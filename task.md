# Take-Home Assignment: Internal Products — Full-Stack Engineer (Mid)

**Company:** TechKraft Inc.  
**Position:** Full Stack Engineer (Mid)  
**Time Limit:** 2.5 hours (150 minutes)  
**Format:** Take-home, submit via public GitHub repository

---

## Overview

You are building an internal candidate scoring and review dashboard for TechKraft's recruitment workflow. This is the kind of internal tool we build regularly — admin UIs, scoring systems, AI-assisted review interfaces.

**Submission:** Create a public GitHub repository with your solution and share the link.

---

## Problem Statement

TechKraft's recruitment team needs a web-based tool to manage candidate assessments. Reviewers need to score candidates across categories and view AI-generated summaries. Admins need full visibility.

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. Backend API (Python/FastAPI)

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /candidates` | List candidates with filters: `status`, `role_applied`, `skill`, `keyword` + pagination |
| `GET /candidates/{id}` | Candidate detail with scores and AI-generated summary |
| `POST /candidates/{id}/scores` | Submit a score for a category (score 1–5, category name, optional note) |
| `POST /candidates/{id}/summary` | Trigger mock AI summary generation — simulates an async LLM call (2s delay) |
| `GET /candidates/{id}/stream` | *(Stretch goal)* SSE endpoint that streams score updates in real time |

**Pagination:** offset-based with configurable page size (default 20, max 50).

---

### 2. Database (DynamoDB-style or SQLite)

Model your data with these entities:

**`candidates`**
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `role_applied`
- `status` — `new` / `reviewed` / `hired` / `rejected`
- `skills` (list/array)
- `internal_notes` (admin-only)
- `created_at`

**`scores`**
- `id`, `candidate_id`, `category`
- `score` (1–5)
- `reviewer_id`, `note`, `created_at`

Use appropriate indexes (e.g., on `candidates.status`, `candidates.role_applied`, `scores.candidate_id`).

---

### 3. Role-Based Access Control

- JWT-based authentication with email + password
- **`reviewer` role:** Can score candidates, sees only their own scores, cannot view `internal_notes`
- **`admin` role:** Can see all scores from all reviewers, can view and edit `internal_notes`
- Registration must hardcode role to `reviewer` — **never accept role from the client**

---

### 4. Frontend (React + Vite)

- **Login page**
- **Candidate list page** with filter controls (`status`, `role`, `skill`, `keyword`) and pagination
- **Candidate detail page** showing:
  - Profile info
  - Scores (reviewer sees own scores; admin sees all)
  - Scoring form (select category + score + note)
  - AI summary section (trigger via button, display loading state while generating)
  - Admin-only internal notes panel

---

### 5. Containerization (Docker Compose)

Docker Compose setup that starts both services:
- Backend (FastAPI on port **8000**)
- Frontend (Vite dev server or nginx static build on port **5173**)

---

### 6. Testing

At least 2–3 tests covering:
- An API endpoint test (e.g., create a candidate, verify response)
- An auth enforcement test (e.g., reviewer cannot see another reviewer's scores)

---

## Debugging Signal

The following query pattern has a subtle bug. In your README, identify the issue, explain why it matters at scale, and describe the correct approach:

```python
# from a hypothetical service layer — what's wrong here?
def search_candidates(status: str, keyword: str, page: int, page_size: int):
    all_candidates = db.execute("SELECT * FROM candidates").fetchall()
    filtered = [c for c in all_candidates if c["status"] == status]
    # ... also filter by keyword in Python ...
    offset = (page - 1) * page_size
    return filtered[offset : offset + page_size]
```

---

## Architecture Decision Record

In your README, include a brief ADR section documenting **2–3 key technical decisions**. For each:
- **Context:** What was the situation?
- **Decision:** What did you choose?
- **Trade-off:** What did you accept?

Examples: why FastAPI over alternatives, why this DB schema shape, how auth is handled.

---

## Learning Reflection

In your README, add 2–3 sentences on one thing you tried for the first time or one approach you'd explore given more time.

---

## Responsibility & Detail Checks

These are automatically verified by the evaluator:
- Credentials must **NOT** be committed (use `.env.example` with dummy values)
- README commands and port numbers must match the actual system
- The mock AI summary endpoint must show loading/error states in the frontend (not just a blank page while waiting)
- If a candidate is deleted, it must be a **soft delete** (set `status = "archived"` or add `deleted_at`) — never hard-delete

---

## Evaluation Criteria

| Category | Weight | What We're Looking For |
|---|---|---|
| Problem Solving | 15% | Filter/pagination design, API structure, handling edge cases |
| Core Technical | 15% | FastAPI async patterns, React component architecture, DB schema + indexing |
| System Design | 10% | ADR quality, data flow reasoning, serverless-aware design thinking |
| Code Quality | 10% | Code organization, error handling, naming, separation of concerns |
| Debugging | 10% | Correctly identifying the bug snippet issue and explaining the fix |
| Practical Experience | 5% | Docker Compose setup, env config, real-world patterns (soft delete, error handling) |
| Communication | 5% | README clarity, ADR explanations, setup instructions |
| Ownership | 10% | All core requirements completed, limitations honestly acknowledged |
| Learning | 10% | Learning reflection quality, tool choice reasoning |
| Culture Fit | 5% | Testing included, security awareness (no credentials, no role spoofing) |
| Responsibility & Detail | 5% | Docs match system, no committed credentials, subtle constraints met, AI/human tool use verified |

### Automatic Caps

> The **Responsibility & Detail** score is capped at **2** if any of the following occur:
> - Role accepted from client at registration
> - `.env` with real credentials committed
> - README port/command contradicts actual system
> - Core requirement absent with no acknowledgement

## Tips

- Focus on **quality over quantity** — a complete, working submission with fewer features beats a broken one with everything attempted
- Run your Docker Compose setup and test at least one `curl` command before submitting
- Explain trade-offs honestly in your ADR
- Make sure your README port numbers match your Docker Compose configuration
- The LLM endpoint is a mock — show you understand how async external API calls should work
- If you use AI tools, verify every line before submitting

---

## Submission Instructions

1. Create a public GitHub repository
2. Push your code
3. Share the repository URL
4. Ensure `README.md` is at the root with:
   - Setup and run instructions
   - ADR section (2–3 decisions)
   - Debugging bug identification
   - Learning reflection
   - Example API calls (curl commands)

---

*Good luck. We're looking forward to seeing your approach to building the kind of internal tools our team ships every day.*
